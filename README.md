# Panther

A collection of [Gentoo](https://www.gentoo.org/) ebuilds which I couldn't find elsewhere.

## Contents

* `app-misc/ckb-next`: an ebuild for [ckb-next](https://github.com/mattanger/ckb-next), the surviving fork of [ckb](https://github.com/ccMSC/ckb). Provides very nice drives for Corsair keyboards and mice.
* `net-wireless/broadcom-sta`: contains an `r6` version with patches for kernels >= 5.1.
* `media-gfx/max2pdf`: a tool to convert paperport max files to PDF files. Based off of Simon Glass' [paperman](https://github.com/sglass68/paperman); see https://github.com/orangeturtle739/max2pdf.
* `sci-electronics/verilator`: the fastest free Verilog HDL simulator.
* `sci-electronics/quartus-prime-lite`: a quartus prime lite setup with included libfontconfig and libfreetype binaries.
