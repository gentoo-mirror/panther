# Panther

A collection of [Gentoo](https://www.gentoo.org/) ebuilds which I couldn't find elsewhere.

## Contents

* `app-misc/ckb`: an ebuild for [ckb-next](https://github.com/mattanger/ckb-next), the surviving fork of [ckb](https://github.com/ccMSC/ckb). Provides very nice drives for Corsair keyboards and mice.
